# MediQuery Healthcare Assistant ðŸ©º

## Overview
MediQuery is an AI-powered Healthcare Assistant that leverages advanced NLP techniques, vector embeddings (Cohere AI), and Pinecone's vector database for real-time retrieval of medical information from trusted resources such as PubMed. The assistant provides accurate, evidence-based answers to medical queries, symptom analysis, and healthcare guidance.
